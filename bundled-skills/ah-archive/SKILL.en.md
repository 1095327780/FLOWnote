# ah-archive

Run project closeout: retrospective, extraction, archival, and index updates.

## Must Follow

- Default minimal memory read: `STATUS + target project summary`.
- Confirm project status and key deliverables before archiving.
- Keep project links pointed to `📍 项目总览.md`.

## Workflow

1. Confirm which project to archive.
2. Check completion and unresolved items.
3. Run retrospective prompts (outcomes/learnings/reusable patterns/leftovers).
4. Generate archive summary and move files to archive path.
5. Update domain page, `STATUS.md`, and `index.json`.

## Read References On Demand

- Pre-archive checklist and retrospective template: `references/archive-playbook.md`

## Output

- Archive path.
- Retrospective summary.
- Optional card candidates for `ah-card`.
