# Daily Review Playbook

## Review Sequence

1. Completion check (focus item)
2. Reflection (what worked / what blocked)
3. Idea triage (`review_triage`)
4. Tomorrow focus

## Reflection Prompts

- "What was the most valuable progress today?"
- "What was the biggest blocker?"
- "What is tomorrow's most important task?"

## `review_triage` Execution

For each unprocessed idea:
- ask one decision question
- execute selected path
- write marker back to source

## Closeout Conditions

- all visible items triaged or explicitly skipped
- tomorrow focus captured
- daily memory updated

## Anti-patterns

- forcing deep reflection when user asks quick mode
- creating cards directly here instead of `ah-card`
