# Daily Review Playbook

## Review Sequence

1. Completion check (focus item)
2. Reflection (what worked / what blocked)
3. Idea triage (`review_triage`)
4. Tomorrow focus

## Reflection Prompts

- "今天最有价值的进展是什么？"
- "最大的阻塞是什么？"
- "明天最重要的一件事是什么？"

## `review_triage` Execution

For each unprocessed idea:
- ask one decision question
- execute selected path
- write marker back to source

## Closeout Conditions

- all visible items triaged or explicitly skipped
- tomorrow focus captured
- daily memory updated

## Anti-patterns

- forcing deep reflection when user requests quick mode
- creating cards directly here instead of `ah-card`
