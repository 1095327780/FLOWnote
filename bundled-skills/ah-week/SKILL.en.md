# ah-week

Run weekly review: analyze trends, clear leftovers, and set next-week priorities.

## Must Follow

- Memory read mode: cross-layer summaries only (no full history expansion).
- Template: `assets/templates/Weekly-Review-Template.md`
- Unresolved items must follow the same triage rule as daily review.

## Workflow

1. Summarize this week's daily/card/project data.
2. Scan and clear unresolved weekly ideas.
3. Guide reflection: worked well / needs improvement / constraints for next week.
4. Generate and write weekly review note.
5. Update cycle status in `STATUS.md`.

## Read References On Demand

- Weekly metrics and prompt templates: `references/weekly-review-details.md`

## Output

- Weekly metrics summary.
- Cleanup result for unresolved items.
- One to three focus goals for next week.
