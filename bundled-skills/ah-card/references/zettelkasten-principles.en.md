# Core Zettelkasten Principles

## Three Core Principles

### 1. Atomicity

One card should hold one core idea.

Checklist:
- Can the core be summarized in one sentence?
- Prefer 300-500 words for one complete point.
- Avoid mixing unrelated concepts.

### 2. Decontextualization

A card should be understandable without opening the source.

Checklist:
- Rewrite in your own words.
- Avoid phrases like “the author says” as the main expression.
- A reader should understand the card independently.

### 3. Connectivity

Each card should have meaningful links.

Checklist:
- At least 2-3 bidirectional links when possible.
- Explicitly label relationship type (support/contrast/extend/application/source).
- Link to topic/domain hubs.

## Three Filter Questions

Before promoting to evergreen card, ask:

1. Does this idea contribute to my thinking, writing, or project?
2. Can this note stand alone without original context?
3. Can I connect it to at least one existing note?

## Typical Anti-patterns

- One card contains an entire chapter.
- Mostly copied quotes with little personal interpretation.
- No backlinks and no source trace.
