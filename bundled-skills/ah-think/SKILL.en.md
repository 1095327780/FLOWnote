# ah-think

Run pluggable structured-thinking sessions for complex decomposition and decisions.

## Must Follow

- Default minimal memory read: `STATUS + current context layer`.
- Templates: `assets/templates/Thinking-Template.md` or `assets/templates/Project-Thinking-Template.md`.
- Output must end with executable conclusions. Avoid abstract discussion.

## Available Models (pick one)

- First Principles
- Socratic Questioning
- Second-order Thinking
- Inversion
- Five Whys
- Feynman Technique
- Circle of Competence

References:
- `references/first-principles.md`
- `references/socratic-questioning.md`
- `references/second-order-thinking.md`
- `references/inversion.md`
- `references/five-whys.md`
- `references/feynman-technique.md`
- `references/circle-of-competence.md`

## Workflow

1. Clarify problem and boundaries.
2. Select one thinking model.
3. Produce structured reasoning: hypotheses, evidence, counterexamples, conclusion.
4. Provide action items and validation checks.
5. Write back to related context memory.

## Output

- Conclusions (1-3 items)
- Action items (executable)
- Optional card candidates
