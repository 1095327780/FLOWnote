# First Principles Thinking

## Purpose

Break a problem down to fundamental facts and rebuild a solution from scratch.

## Core Moves

1. Identify assumptions that are treated as “obvious”.
2. Separate immutable facts from conventions.
3. Reconstruct options from the fact layer.

## Prompt Pattern

- What assumptions are we making?
- Which assumptions are facts vs habits?
- If we start from facts only, what options emerge?

## Output Requirement

- one reframed problem statement
- one fact table (facts vs assumptions)
- one reconstructed action path
