# Inversion

## Purpose

Improve decisions by identifying failure paths first, then avoiding them.

## Core Moves

1. Define target outcome.
2. Ask: “How would we definitely fail?”
3. List failure behaviors and conditions.
4. Build prevention actions.

## Prompt Pattern

- What actions would guarantee failure here?
- Which of those are already present?
- What one prevention rule should be added now?

## Output Requirement

- failure checklist
- current risk exposure
- prevention plan
