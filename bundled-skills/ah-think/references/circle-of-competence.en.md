# Circle of Competence

## Purpose

Improve decisions by staying within known expertise boundaries and handling unknowns explicitly.

## Core Moves

1. Separate what you truly know from what you only think you know.
2. Mark boundary areas as uncertain.
3. Choose actions that match competence level.
4. Escalate or gather evidence before crossing the boundary.

## Prompt Pattern

- Which parts are inside your real competence?
- Which parts are uncertain but critical?
- What evidence is needed before deciding?

## Output Requirement

- in-circle / boundary / out-of-circle map
- risk statement for boundary areas
- next evidence-seeking step
