# Second-order Thinking

## Purpose

Evaluate not only direct effects, but downstream effects over time.

## Core Moves

1. Describe first-order outcome (immediate effect).
2. Ask “then what?” for second-order effect.
3. Repeat once more for third-order trajectory.
4. Compare short-term gain vs long-term consequence.

## Prompt Pattern

- If we do X now, what happens immediately?
- Then what happens next?
- What unintended consequence appears later?

## Output Requirement

- first/second/third-order chain
- key tradeoff statement
- recommended decision with rationale
