# Socratic Questioning

## Purpose

Use structured questions to expose hidden assumptions and improve reasoning quality.

## Six Question Types

1. Clarification: what exactly do we mean?
2. Assumptions: what must be true for this to hold?
3. Evidence: what supports this claim?
4. Alternatives: what other views exist?
5. Consequences: what follows if this is true?
6. Meta-question: why is this question important?

## Prompt Pattern

- “What do you mean by X?”
- “What assumption is underneath?”
- “What would disconfirm this?”
- “What is the strongest alternative explanation?”

## Output Requirement

- clarified claim
- tested assumptions
- revised conclusion
