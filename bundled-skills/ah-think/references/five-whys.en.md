# Five Whys

## Purpose

Trace surface symptoms to root causes through iterative “why” questions.

## Core Moves

1. State the observable problem clearly.
2. Ask why it happened.
3. Ask why again on the previous answer.
4. Continue until a controllable root cause appears.

## Stop Condition

Stop when the cause is:
- actionable
- specific
- likely to prevent recurrence if fixed

## Output Requirement

- why-chain (at least 3 levels)
- identified root cause
- corrective action and owner
